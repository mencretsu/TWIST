TWIST - Twitter Shilling Bot
=============================

TWIST is a simple tool that automates the practice of shilling on Twitter. It is designed to promote a particular cryptocurrency or investment by posting positive comments, retweets, and other engagements on Twitter.

Using TWIST, a Twitter shilling bot, to promote a cryptocurrency or investment is unethical, fraudulent, and can mislead investors, leading to significant losses. Twitter and regulatory bodies are taking measures to detect and remove shilling bots.
