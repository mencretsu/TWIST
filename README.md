TWIST is a simple tool that automates the practice of shilling on Twitter. It is designed to promote a particular cryptocurrency or investment by posting positive comments, retweets, and other engagements on Twitter.

Disclaimer
-----------
However, the use of Twitter shilling bots is generally considered unethical and fraudulent. This bot can mislead investors and manipulate markets, leading to significant losses for those who are taken in by false or exaggerated claims. As a result, Twitter has taken steps to detect and remove shilling bots, and regulatory bodies have begun to crack down on the practice.
